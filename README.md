# Comme Ã€ La Maison

This script will install vim(with my conf), Oh-My-Bash (with a custom theme) and my bashrc will be copied in order to get my aliases. It will also create an user for you, you just have to put the name of the user as argument of the script.

For the moment, there's only one version: with pacman but later, there will be versions with others package managers.
