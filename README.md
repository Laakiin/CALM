# Comme Ã€ La Maison

This script will install i3(with my conf), Oh-My-Bash (with a custom theme) and my bashrc will be copied in order to get my aliases. It will also create an user for you, you just have to put the name of the user as argument of the script.

The current version supports Arch and Debian based distros.

If you want to install it:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Laakiin/CALM.git && cd CALM && ./install.sh [username]
```
